# combined_rloops_hic_map
The script feature_hic_metaplot.R was developed firstly to evaluate the chromatin contacts enviroment of a set of R loops in order to compare those that can cause a co-directional or head-on conflict with the replication fork. Although, you can use it to generate HiC data metaplots around a any feature. The input must be a .hic matrix, the output that comes from applying the Juicer pipeline (Aiden Lab) to a HiC experiment. straw R package from Aiden Lab (https://github.com/aidenlab/straw/tree/master/R) and HiTC package (Servant N, Lajoie BR, Nora EP, Giorgetti L, Chen C, Heard E, Dekker J, Barillot E (2012). “HiTC: Exploration of High-Throughput 'C' experiments.” Bioinformatics. doi: 10.1093/bioinformatics/bts521.) were used to read and process the input.hic file.
